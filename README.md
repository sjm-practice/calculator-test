# calculator-test
This is a simple client side calculator, used for practicing testing client side javascript (with mocha, chai, sinon, karma, grunt).


## Usage
### To run mocha test via browser
* run: python -m SimpleHTTPServer  (from project root directory)
* in browser, go to http://localhost:8000/test
* NOTE: if you open index.html as a file, blanket mocha will not load the source file successfully, and the coverage statics will be NaN
